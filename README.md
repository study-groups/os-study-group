Resources for studying operating systems.

## Resources
- [OSTEP](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)  The book is centered around three 
conceptual pieces that are fundamental to operating systems: virtualization, concurrency, 
and persistence. In understanding the conceptual, you will also learn the practical,
including how an operating system does things like schedule the CPU, manage memory, and 
store files persistently.

- [xv6 at MIT](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2012/xv6.html)
Xv6 is a teaching operating system developed in the summer of 2006 for MIT's operating systems course, 
[6.828: Operating System Engineering](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2019/).
  - [Commentary on the Sixth Edition UNIX Operating System](http://www.lemis.com/grog/Documentation/Lions/): 
  The book mentioned by Tanenbaum. It was published in 2 column format. The section on reading C code is 
  great. It helps to remember all code must be compiled down to assembly instructions which are 
  executed by the CPU. [Registers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11_architecture#CPU_registers)
  on the CPU hold pointers to memory.

- [XINU](https://xinu.cs.purdue.edu/): XINU stands for Xinu Is Not Unix -- although it 
shares concepts and even names with Unix, the internal design differs completely. Xinu is a 
small, elegant operating system that supports dynamic process creation, dynamic memory allocation,
network communication, local and remote file systems, a shell, and device-independent I/O 
functions. The small size makes Xinu suitable for embedded environments.
